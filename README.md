## Description

  This is a tetris game implementation based on a React & Redux Tetris Tutorial created and built by Mitchell Hudson. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/React-Redux-Tetris-Tutorial).
## Overview

  The high-level overview & implementation strategy, as outlined in the original tutorial is as follows:
  1. Implement the overall grid square
  2. Implement the game board
  3. Implement the "next block" area
  4. Implement the scoreboard
  5. Arrange the layout of the game
  6. Implement the controls
  7. Implement the message popup
  8. Implement the actions and reducers
  9. Do some code organizing and cleanup
  10. Implement state and shapes
  11. Connect each component up to the state and reducers
  12. Implement block rotation
  13. Implement moving blocks
  14. Building a timer system
  15. Implementing Game Over and Restart
