## Summary

The Tetris Game project is an interactive web application built using modern web technologies, including React, Redux Toolkit, Webpack, Babel, and deployed on Netlify. This project was designed to showcase proficiency in front-end development, state management with Redux, and efficient deployment practices.

This build was inspired by [this](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/React-Redux-Tetris-Tutorial).

## Features

1. **Classic Tetris Gameplay**: The application faithfully replicates the classic Tetris experience, providing players with the familiar challenge of arranging falling blocks to create complete lines.

2. **React Components**: The game's user interface is built using React, allowing for a modular and efficient component-based architecture. This enables easy customization and maintenance of the game's various elements.

3. **Redux State Management**: Redux and Redux Toolkit were employed to manage the game's state, ensuring a predictable and centralized approach to handling game logic, score tracking, and level progression.

4. **Webpack and Babel Setup**: The project was set up and configured with Webpack and Babel, facilitating efficient bundling, transpiling, and optimization of the codebase for production deployment.

5. **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be responsive, ensuring an enjoyable and seamless gaming experience across a wide range of devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

6. **High Score Tracking**: The application includes a high score tracking feature, allowing players to compete for the highest score and providing an additional layer of engagement.

7. **Netlify Deployment**: The game is deployed on Netlify, a powerful and user-friendly platform for hosting static websites. This ensures reliable and scalable hosting with continuous integration and automated deployment workflows.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
